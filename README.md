# Musubi Tuner WAN 2.2 GUI

A graphical user interface for WAN 2.2 LoRA training, built on top of the [kohya-ss/musubi-tuner](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner) project. This GUI simplifies the configuration, execution, and monitoring of LoRA training workflows for WAN 2.2 models.

## Overview

This fork provides an intuitive visual interface for training LoRA adapters on WAN 2.2 models, supporting both high-noise and low-noise DiT architectures. The GUI handles complex parameter configurations, real-time monitoring.

**Note**: This GUI is experimental and optimized for Windows systems. Other platforms may require adjustments.

## Usage

### Launching the GUI

**Windows**: Double-click `LAUNCH_GUI.bat`

**Other Platforms**: 
```bash
python musubi_tuner_gui.py
```

### Basic Workflow

EDIT your .TOML dataset file in the dataset folder, IMPORTANT! Don't use backslashes "\" when you paste your dataset path, use "/" slashs instead (on notepad ++, CTRL+H to replace all backslashes)

Launch ACCELERATE config (last tab, follow instructions, only once)

1. **Configure Paths**
   - Set your dataset TOML file path
   - Specify model paths (DiT, VAE, text encoders)
   - Choose output directory and LoRA filename

2. **Set Training Parameters**
   - Configure learning rate, epochs, and network dimensions
   - Select optimizer and scheduler options
   - Adjust advanced settings as needed

3. **Enable Caching (First Run)**
   - Check latents and/or text encoder caching options
   - Required for initial training or when dataset changes

4. **Start Training**
   - Switch to "Run & Monitor" tab
   - Click "Start Training" to begin
   - Monitor progress via console, graph, and VRAM usage

5. **Save Configuration**
   - Use "Save Settings" to save your configuration
   - Settings auto-save on GUI close anyway

*   **IMPORTANT:** Use caching on your first run or when adding new data to your dataset to speed up initialization.
*   Monitor VRAM usage to optimize memory settings with `blocks_to_swap`, batch size, and resolution.


### Dual Model Training Methods
Here are the four distinct methods for training both the High and Low noise models.

---

### 1. Manually Sequential Training
*This is a fully manual workflow where you run two separate training jobs yourself, one for each model.*

*   **How to Configure:**
    1.  **Part 1:** Check **only** `Train High Noise Model` and run the training to completion.
    2.  **Part 2:** Return, uncheck the low noise model, check **only** `Train Low Noise Model`, and start the second training.

*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   **VRAM Usage:** **Moderate.** Very friendly to lower-VRAM systems.
    *   **Training Speed:** **Good.** Each session runs at full speed.
    *   **Best Use Case:** The **highly recommended alternative** to Method 2 for users with limited VRAM. It is predictable, efficient, and avoids the crippling speed loss.

 ---

### 2. Sequentially (Two Separate Trainings)
*This method automatically runs two training sessions back-to-back when you set different LoRA parameters for each model.*

*   **How to Configure:**
    1.  Go to the **"Model Paths & Dataset"** tab and check **both** `Train High Noise Model` and `Train Low Noise Model`.
    2.  Go to the **"Training Parameters"** tab and enter **different** values for `Network Dimension (Rank)` or `Network Alpha` for the high noise model.

*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   **VRAM Usage:** **Moderate.** Only one DiT model is loaded into VRAM at a time.
    *   **Training Speed:** **Good.** Each session runs at full speed.
    *   **Best Use Case:** Required when you intentionally want different LoRA ranks or alphas for each model, using the same dataset and learning rate. / If you want to automate training both models            during the night.

---

### 3. Combined (Single Run - Very High VRAM Usage)
*This is the fastest and most efficient method, running a single unified process that trains both models simultaneously by keeping them both in VRAM.*
Similar to AI toolkit when both models are selected with LOW VRAM "OFF"

*   **How to Configure:**
    1.  Go to the **"Model Paths & Dataset"** tab and check **both** `Train High Noise Model` and `Train Low Noise Model`.
    2.  In the **"Training Parameters"** tab, leave the high noise model's `Network Dimension` and `Network Alpha` **blank**.
    3.  In the **"Advanced Settings"** tab, ensure `Offload Inactive DiT Model` is **UNCHECKED**.

*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   **VRAM Usage:** **Very High.** Requires enough VRAM to hold both DiT models (Too much for consumer grade GPU).
    *   **Training Speed:** **Fastest.** The most time-efficient method.
    *   **Best Use Case:** The default and highly recommended method for users with sufficient VRAM.

---

### 4. Combined (Single Run - VRAM Saving Mode)
*This method attempts a combined run on low-VRAM systems by constantly swapping the inactive model between VRAM and system RAM, causing a high performance bottleneck.*
Similar to AI toolkit when both models are selected with LOW VRAM "ON"

*   **How to Configure:**
    1.  Go to the **"Model Paths & Dataset"** tab and check **both** `Train High Noise Model` and `Train Low Noise Model`.
    2.  In the **"Training Parameters"** tab, leave the high noise model's `Network Dimension` and `Network Alpha` **blank**.
    3.  In the **"Advanced Settings"** tab, **CHECK** the `Offload Inactive DiT Model` option.

*   **Key Attributes:**
    *   **VRAM Usage:** **Low.** Drastically reduces VRAM consumption.
    *   **Training Speed:** **Slow.** The performance cost is crippling.
    *   **Best Use Case:**
        > **WARNING:** This option has no real practical use case and should be avoided. The speed penalty is so significant that it is almost always slower than running two separate trainings (Method 1 or 2).
